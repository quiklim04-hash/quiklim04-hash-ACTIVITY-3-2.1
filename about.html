    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Quik Cler Lim</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        My name is Quik Cler Lim, and I am both a dedicated student and one of Milan Milan Milendo's boxers for the 2023–2024 season. Before joining Milan’s team, I already had 4 to 5 years of boxing experience under my belt. I was eager and determined to enter the competitive fighting scene, training hard under my coach’s guidance. However, my parents were concerned about the risks and challenges that come with stepping into the ring—especially my father, who has firsthand experience in boxing himself. Out of respect for their concerns, I chose to delay competing and instead focus on further training and learning.

That decision was not easy, but it taught me valuable lessons about patience, discipline, and perseverance. It gave me time to refine my skills, improve my technique, and build a strong mental foundation. I learned that boxing isn’t just about physical strength; it’s about strategy, resilience, and having the courage to keep moving forward even when things get tough.

Although I may not yet consider myself the best boxer out there, I am confident in the value and potential I bring to the sport. My journey has been about more than just winning fights—it’s about continuous growth and self-improvement. I approach every training session with an open mind and a willingness to learn something new. Each challenge I face is an opportunity to become better, both as an athlete and as a person.

Looking ahead, I am committed to pushing my limits and embracing every chance to develop my skills. Whether it’s learning new techniques, improving my fitness, or understanding the mental game, I am ready to put in the work. I believe that success in boxing, like in life, comes from dedication, respect, and an unyielding drive to grow.

I am proud to be part of Milan Milan Milendo’s team and grateful for the support I’ve received from my family and coaches. Together, we’re building a foundation for a promising future—one fight, one lesson, and one day at a time.
